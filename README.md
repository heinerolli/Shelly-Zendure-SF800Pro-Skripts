# Shelly-Zendure-SF800Pro-Skripts
A collection of scripts to run on a shelly device to i.e. do Zero Grid feed wo cloud and / or other hardware then the Shelly and the SF800pro (and WLAN)
The 1st script is based on the ideas of ZenUser2421C25j and what he shared in this thread in theZendure forum:
https://forum.zendure.com/d/18610
All is based on and further details / instructions / ideas can be obtained from the Zendure SDK:
https://github.com/Zendure/zenSDK

My initial scripts are using a Shelly Plus Plug S to measure Power.
Changing this to i.e. using a Shelly Pro 3EM and similar devices is easy using the Shelly script library:
